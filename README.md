# Coffee House

One of my first Web App hosted on firebase, Coffee House is a discussion forum, where you can create rooms on different topics and discuss with your friends and colleagues. The app provides a very seamless experience of a discussion and a user friendly environment.

## Rooms

Rooms have a topic, a description and a password which is optional.
Creators of the rooms will not have to enter the password everytime.

## Security

The public rooms are open to all for viewing messages. A login is required to send messages.
The private rooms require password for anyone except the creator.

## Contributing

Fork the repo and clone the project on your computer. 
Go into the folder and on the terminal run the command ```npm start``` to get the development server up and running for previewing on the localhost.
